Notebook
========

Simple test project i am writing to play around with various ideas for a programmatic notebook as well as getting used to using git for development.

The idea was to try out a few ideas i wanted to try out in python due its interpreted nature.

Some key points about this Notebook:
* Uses a suffix tree to index the contents of input files
* Provides various commands that can be used to search for words and related meta-data
* provides extra functionality such as provided a help for each command using 'man <command>'
